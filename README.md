Now we are in the Prepare phase. 

I will use Cyclistic's historical data (found here : https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) to analyze and identify trends. 

The data has been made avaiable by Motivate International Inc. It is a public dataset that can be used to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. 

Due to data privacy reasons, we would be unable to use riders' personally identifiable information. This means that I wouldn't be able  to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine whether casual drivers live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
