# bike_share_success
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! A case study where I've performed data analysis for a fictional bike-share company called Cyclistic, in order to help them attract more riders. 

This case study will be done by following the data analysis process: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share,** and **Act**.

Scenario:

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclist, a bike-sharing company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, I iwll design a new marketig strategy to convert casual riders into anual members. For this to happen, Cyclist executives must approve the recommendations so this must be backed up with compelling data insights and professiona data visualizations. 
  
A little background about the company: 

Cyclistic is a bike-sharing program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

Being a junior data analyst I get to work with a team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketting strategy.

The director of marketing who is mu manager, Lily Moreno has set a clear goal: Designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, our marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.


There are three questions that will guide the future marketing program:
  1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
  2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
  3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members? 
  
**My target question to answer is : How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic differently?**

 5. Supporting visualizations and key finding
 6. My top three recommendations based on the analysis.
