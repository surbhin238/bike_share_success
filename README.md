I will begin the Data Aanlaysis process with the Ask task (It even rhymes!)

The attached report states the following deliverables: 

 1. A clear statement of the business task
 2. A description of all data sources used 
 3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
 4. A summary of my analysis 
 5. Supporting visualizations and key finding
 6. My top three recommendations based on the analysis.
