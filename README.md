# bike_share_success
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! A case study where I've performed data analysis for a fictional bike-share company called Cyclistic, in order to help them attract more riders. 

This case study will be done by following the data analysis process: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share,** and **Act**.

Scenario:

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclist, a bike-sharing company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, I iwll design a new marketig strategy to convert casual riders into anual members. For this to happen, Cyclist executives must approve the recommendations so this must be backed up with compelling data insights and professiona data visualizations.
